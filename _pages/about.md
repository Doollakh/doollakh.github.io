✨ I’m a PhD student, a deep learning researcher and online instructor.

🤖 My current research interests centre on large language models and vision language models, focusing on understanding how LLMs infer cause-and-effect, apply commonsense logic in everyday scenarios, and make decisions that remain consistent under distribution shifts.


### Research Interests:

- 👁‍🗨 **Large Language Models** 
- 📚 **Vision Language Models**
- 🏞️ **Low-rank Adaptation**
- 🤖 **Meta Learning**
- 💥 **Causal Inference**


### Life Interests:

- 🎤 **Presentation**: I love sharing ideas and making complex topics easier to understand. Whether I'm in a classroom or online, creating engaging presentations is something I really enjoy.

- 😍 **Teaching**: Teaching is a big part of my life, and it’s honestly one of the most rewarding experiences.

- 💡 **Solving Problems**: I get excited by the challenge of tackling tricky problems, whether it's in research or real-world applications. It’s all about finding that "lightbulb" moment!
