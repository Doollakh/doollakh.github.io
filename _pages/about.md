✨ I’m a deep learning researcher and online instructor.

🎈 Teaching bridges knowing and understanding—I love sharing knowledge and learning through it.

🔍 I enjoy diving into diverse research to fuel curiosity and inspire both teaching and research.

🤖 Currently, my main interests lie in 3D vision, Meta-learning and Video Understanding which I believe are crucial steps toward achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). 


### Research Interests:

- 👁‍🗨 **Computer Vision** (Detection, Segmentation)
- 🤖 **Meta Learning** (Continual learning, Few-shot learning, Knowledge transfer)
- 🏞️ **3D Vision** (NeRF, 3D/4D Gaussian Splatting)
- 🎥 **Video Understanding** (Egocentric videos)
- 💥 **Self-supervised Learning** (Contrastive learning)
- 📚 **Vision Language Models** (Text-Image Alignment)
- 🏥 **Medical Imaging**

### Life Interests:

- 🎤 **Presentation**: I love sharing ideas and making complex topics easier to understand. Whether I'm in a classroom or online, creating engaging presentations is something I really enjoy.

- 😍 **Teaching**: Teaching is a big part of my life, and it’s honestly one of the most rewarding experiences.

- 💡 **Solving Problems**: I get excited by the challenge of tackling tricky problems, whether it's in research or real-world applications. It’s all about finding that "lightbulb" moment!
