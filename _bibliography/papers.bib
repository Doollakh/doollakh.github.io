  abstract={This paper presents a novel framework for memory-efficient and privacy-preserving continual learning in 3D point cloud classification. Instead of storing numerous exemplars, our method uses a compact shape model that stores only the mean shape and key modes of variation, significantly reducing memory usage while enhancing privacy. The approach includes Gradient Mode Regularization to improve model robustness and stability against input variations.}
